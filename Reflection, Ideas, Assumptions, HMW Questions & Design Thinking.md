**Stakeholders:**
- Customers + repeat clients
- CMC Employees
- Relationship Managers (RMs)
- Developers & Designers
- IT Technicians & Testers
- Sponsors for holiday packages/Investors
- Travel Specialists/Representatives

**Design Thinking Principles**

Design Thinking is an important and useful approach in solving the travel company’s problem. The systematic problem solving approach required is split into five main steps.
Empathise
Define
Ideate
Prototype
Test

1. Empathise

The first step is to empathise, which is to understand the client’s needs and requirements. Empathy maps are a useful visual technique to effectively gain an insight into the client’s perspective by putting ourselves in the user’s shoes. Empathy maps were created for Relationship Managers (RMs), employees and customers to delve deeper into their minds and discover their pains, gains, goals and environment.

2. Define

The second stage in the Design Thinking process is to define the problem that has been identified. The user is essential to this stage of the process, hence user requirements are gathered from the front-end users (customers) and the back-end users (relationship manager, employees). From the empathy maps, insights into user needs and requirements were gained to create point of view statements.

Some point of view statements from  front-end and back-end users include:
- I am a relationship manager at a travel company who wants to maximise the sale of holiday packages. However, I am feeling overwhelmed because there is insufficient staff so I cannot utilise my time efficiently to effectively sell packages.
- I am an employee who is trying to reach target sales by effectively selling holiday packages and providing customers with information. However, I am worried that I am having to speak with customers who require information on holiday packages which fall out of my area of expertise.
- I am a customer who is trying to get holiday package information in the most effective way, so that I can get the best deal and destination. However, I am having difficulty contacting CMC employees and navigating through holiday packages.

Using these, the problem had been defined and the required system features and functionalities had been proposed. Once integrated into the new system, call routing and dynamic call flow for both inbound and outbound calls would be improved, and the system will adjust the call flow rate to suitable relationship managers. The issues are that insufficient call process is leading to some customers waiting in a queue, and that customers and relationship managers are highly segmented, with low scoring customers being served last.

3. Ideate

In this stage, point of view statements are being transformed into how might we questions. This allows us to develop solutions later on. These questions are:

**HMW Statements** - Relationship Managers (RM's)
- How might we provide support to relationship managers? 
- How might we increase sales efficiency? 
- How might we improve our service to provide greater customer satisfaction? 
- How might we provide better offerings to encourage repeat purchases and loyalty? 
- How might we entice potential customers?

**HMW Statements** - Customer
- How might we be able to take more calls and reduce wait times?
- How might we make it easier for customers to choose holiday packages?
- How might we increase the knowledge and skill set of RM’s?
- How might we increase the scores of customers that do not purchase holiday packages?

**HMW Statements** - Employee
- How might we improve workplace productivity for employees?
- How might we improve our customer service?
- How might we retain customers and attract new customers?
- How might we provide customers with accurate information about their chosen destination?
- How might we increase the sales of holiday packages to customers?

In this stage, feature and functionalities were brainstormed, including:
- Grouping holiday packages by price, destination, length of stay to help CMC employees deal with customer enquiries. Addresses the HMW question: How might we make it easier for customers to choose holiday packages? Priority: HIGH.
- Creating a feature that supports the matching of relationship managers and customers. Skill matcher database. Priority: HIGH.
- Developing the Profiler Tool. Priority: HIGH.
- Creating a target list for customers. Priority: MEDIUM.
- The proposed system will be used as a skill matcher between end customers and relationship managers based on their profiles. Priority: MEDIUM.
- Machine learning that learns from customers calling. Make an efficient profiler that learns from customers and captures information.
- Recording the subsequent performance of relationship managers in an efficient manner. Priority: LOW.

4. Prototype

In this stage we focused on creating use case, activity, class and collaborative diagrams. Prototyping potential solutions enables us to understand how the potential system will look.

**Agile Methodology (Scrum)**

As seen in agile methodology, customers are seen as the most important part for developing potential features. During this project, the customer was the focal point for decision making during this project. 

For this project, we initially created a product backlog with a list of features for the potential CMC system with the customer in mind. Over the weeks, we went through the process of backlog refinement to select the most appropriate features for the system. With the help of labeling we prioritised these features to be later used in our prototype diagrams. Furthermore, the project board feature in GitHub mimics the boards commonly used in agile methodology because of its simplicity and flexibility which enabled us to control our tasks and collaborate more efficiently with each other. Additionally, the project board allowed us to gain a clear understanding of what work was to be done and to communicate to other team members about the status of our project. Lastly, another element of agile methodology is the concept of self managing teams. It was crucial for our team to be self organising and be in constant communication to complete this project


**Assumptions and ideas based on case study**
- We assume that the company is understaffed.
- We assume the CMC is a real-life physical office with multiple CMC locations across the globe.
- We assume relationship managers are different from employees. RM’s outrank employees and are responsible for managing and coaching their employees at the CMC.
- We assume the project is based on improving the call management centre by improving the flow of calls.
- We assume employee performance is measured by their level of expertise in holiday packages and how fast they provide accurate information.
- We assume employees over the phone handle customer enquiries, gives quotes and information on holiday packages and process sales. 
- We assume segmented customers are matched to the closest RM in their region or with the correct expertise in their region.
- We assume the employee questionnaire will be a general questionnaire that all employees are required to take. The questionnaire might include things like their knowledge about current holiday packages, have they and how long have they been a part of the travel industry? Do they have any previous customer service experience? What is their language proficiency? What areas of travel expertise are they most confident with? E.g. flight bookings, hotel bookings, transportation bookings and itinerary planning
- We assume the CMC database is synced with the travel company's database.
- We assume a customer profile is automatically created if there is not an existing profile in the system.
- We assume all calls are recorded and consent has been acquired so that RM and customer profiles are automatically updated after each call.
