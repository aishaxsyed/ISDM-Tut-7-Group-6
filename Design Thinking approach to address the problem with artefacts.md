**Reflection, Ideas, Assumptions and HMW Questions**
- Develop HMW questions from POV statements
- Use stages 1 and 2 from Design Thinking

**Assumptions and ideas based on case study**
- We assume that the company is understaffed.
- We assume the CMC is a real-life physical office with multiple CMC locations across the globe.
- We assume relationship managers are different from employees. RM’s outrank employees and are responsible for managing and coaching their employees at the CMC.
- We assume the project is based on improving the call management centre by improving the flow of calls.
- We assume employee performance is measured by their level of expertise in holiday packages and how fast they provide accurate information.
- We assume employees over the phone handle customer enquiries, gives quotes and information on holiday packages and process sales. 
- We assume segmented customers are matched to the closest RM in their region or with the correct expertise in their region.
- We assume the employee questionnaire will be a general questionnaire that all employees are required to take. The questionnaire might include things like their knowledge about current holiday packages, have they and how long have they been a part of the travel industry? Do they have any previous customer service experience? What is their language proficiency? What areas of travel expertise are they most confident with? E.g. flight bookings, hotel bookings, transportation bookings and itinerary planning

**HMW Statements** - Relationship Managers (RM's)
- How might we provide support to relationship managers? 
- How might we increase sales efficiency? 
- How might we improve our service to provide greater customer satisfaction? 
- How might we provide better offerings to encourage repeat purchases and loyalty? 
- How might we entice potential customers?

**HMW Statements** - Customer
- How might we be able to take more calls and reduce wait times?
- How might we make it easier for customers to choose holiday packages?
- How might we increase the knowledge and skill set of RM’s?
- How might we increase the scores of customers that that do not purchase holiday packages?
