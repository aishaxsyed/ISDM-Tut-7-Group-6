**<h3>Introduction</h3>**

The purpose of this report is to document the design, methodology and prototype of an efficient information system that is customised to match the travel company’s business requirements. The aim of the system is to enhance the travel company’s daily operations, workplace productivity and financial position. Implementing an automated information system will streamline the operations and processes of the company’s call management centre (CMC) by providing improved call routing and dynamic call flow control for inbound and outbound calls, and matching relationship managers (RMs) and customers according to the skills and expertise of the RMs and the profiles of the customers. The report will present a prototype of the proposed automated system to deliver the functionalities that have been put in place to ensure the client is satisfied.

The development of this system requires the use of software development methodologies such as Scrum and Design Thinking principles. These methodologies have been incorporated to find a plausible solution to the company’s situation and provide value to the travel company. This report will explore these methodologies in detail and explain the steps involved in the Design Thinking process. Screenshots of the diagrams have been included to help communicate the process. Competitive advantages and possible effects of project failure have also been explored.
