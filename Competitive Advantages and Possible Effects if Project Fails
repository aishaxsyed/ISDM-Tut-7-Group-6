**Competitive Advantages**

The design thinking and agile methodology ensures low chances of the system malfunctioning, though constant refinement of the system is required through evaluation and feedback of the system. This prototype will produce the most plausible solution for the company, delivering the best value.

The proposed software system has many potential competitive advantages for the travel company. The first and foremost is that the daily operations of the workplace will be streamlined due to this system. This, in turn, will increase the chances of relationship managers and employees maximising the sales of holiday packages. This will be possible by the increase in effective customer service due to the improved call routing and dynamic call flow control for inbound and outbound calls, helping employees serve end-customers and potential customers. Customer service is also improved by the system matching relationship managers and end-customers according to relationship managersâ€™ skills and customer profiles; thereby finding employees who know the needs and requirements of the customers they will be assisting. Customers will be served quickly and have shorter call waiting times, increasing customer satisfaction. Improving customer service will maximise sales of holiday packages, which will increase revenue for the company and help them gain reputation among other travel companies.

**Possible Effects if Project Fails**

Despite the rigorous designing, prototyping and testing, the information system may not work as intended, resulting in adverse effects for the business. There are numerous advantages that might be gained from developing the new information system, however, if the project fails, there are many possible adverse effects for the business.

There is a possibility of the system crashing or containing bugs and technical issues. There is also the possibility of the system malfunctioning and routing calls to the wrong employees. If this happens, the company will have to revert to their old system of calling and receiving calls. This will have a negative impact on the company as it will reduce customer satisfaction, which will result in the loss of profit. During the period of time the system is not functioning as intended, the result will be loss of revenue, decreased customer satisfaction, and loss of reputation.
